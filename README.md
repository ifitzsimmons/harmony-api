## To Do
1. Add error wrapping for http requests. Harmony returns 200 status with error in body. Need to wrap/handle API calls
2. More robust address utils/bech32 encoding. Find documentation for parsing data.
3. Add ReadMe
4. Add contributions file
5. Add pre-push script that will run tests
6. Add pipeline that will distribute package and test.
7. Build distribution package for ts and js
8. Figure out why I had to use babel and old versions of jest/ts-jest in order to run tests. This can be open sourced.
